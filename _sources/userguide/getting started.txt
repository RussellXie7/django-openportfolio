Getting Started
===============

To use |project-name|, you must first populate the database with some data.  

Step 1 - Use the Admin interface to create some portfolio objects

Detailed instructions on using this interface can be found here: :doc:`admin`.  At a minimum you will need to:

1.  Create a benchmark portfolio

2.  Create a portfolio to hold your investments

3.  Create an asset class and assign it to the benchmark portfolio

4.  Create a currency eg: GBP

5.  Create a company

6.  Create a savings account or listed equity investment and assign it to the company

7.  Enter portfolio trades 

8.  For savings accounts, you will also need to enter an Interest Rate


Step 2 - Download price data

The best way to perform the initial price data update is using fabric::

	$ fab development openportfolio-update --initial

See :doc:`installation` for more information on how this process can be automated to maintain price data on an ongoing basis.

The openportfolio-update script will perform a number of tasks:

* update investment prices an the day specified in Settings
* calculate and save portfolio level data
