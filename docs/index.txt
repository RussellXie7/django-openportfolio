Open Portfolio
==============

|project-name| is an open source portfolio management tool, motivated by tools used by professional fund managers.  It can be used to manage and monitor the returns and risks of a portfolio of investments such as listed equities and fixed income securities.    See :doc:`finance-concepts` for a user-friendly overview of the important concepts of portfolio management.

Main Features
--------------

* vs benchmark portfolio reporting
* portfolio grouping allowing for aggregate and sub-portfolio level reporting
* multi-currency support
* total return focus
* fifo / lifo trade allocations for tax reporting
* risk modelling across different risk buckets
* charting using the Highcharts library
* pricing data sourced from yahoo finance
* trade import from csv or ofx files

Why?
-----

This project aims to make the tools of professional fund managers more open and accessible.  Such tools are typically closed source, expensive and inflexible.  As an open source platform, |project-name| offers the opportunity for everyday investors to better manage their portfolios - thereby being aware of their risks and having the ability to maximise their returns.


The `OpenPortfolio`_ Project is hosted on github.
